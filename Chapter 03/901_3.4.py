# Define two variables and assign boolean values to it
a = True
b = False
print(a) # True
print(b) # False
print(not a) # Output: False, which is opposite of ‘a’ value
print(not b) # Output: True, which is opposite of ‘ b’ value
print(a and a) # Output: True, which is True and True is True
print(a and b) # Output: False, which is True and False is False
print(b and b) # Output: False, which is False and False is False
print(a and not b) # Output: True, which is True and True (opposite of False) is True
print(b  and not a) # Output: False, which is False and False (opposite of False) is False
print(a or a) # Output: True, which is True or True is True
print(a or b) # Output: True, which is True or False is True
print(b or b) # Output: False, which is False or False is False
# We can use comparison operators to obtain boolean values
print(5 == 5) # Output:  True
print(5 <= 5) # Output: True
print(5 != 5) # Output: False
print(5 < 10) # Output: True
print(5 >= 10) # Output: False
print(5 > 10) # Output: False
